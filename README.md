# Welcome to DevX at NEAR!

This is the place to find out what we're adding to our developer tools and experiences, see how you can contribute, and see who on the core team is a good person to ask questions to.

## What am I looking at?

This is where DevX for the NEAR collective is managed. You'll want [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) (A project management extension for GitHub issues) to see the overall epics. You can view what's in progress in the issues without it. If you have ideas for what you'd like to see specific to your experience as a developer, this is a great place to suggest.

## How do I use this repo?

You can submit an issue like any other repo. These are automatically added to the `icebox` and we review these each Tuesday at 9am PST in sync. We also watch this outside of that time.
