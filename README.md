# Welcome to DevX at NEAR!

This is the place to find out what we're adding to our developer tools and experiences, see how you can contribute, and see who on the core team is a good person to ask questions to.

## What am I looking at?

This is where DevX for the NEAR collective is managed. You'll want [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) (A project management extension for GitHub issues) to see the overall epics. You can view what's in progress in the issues without it. If you have ideas for what you'd like to see specific to your experience as a developer, this is a great place to suggest.

## How do I use this repo?

You can submit an issue like any other repo. These are automatically added to the `icebox` and we review these each Tuesday at 9am PST in sync. We also watch this outside of that time.

### Retro

* Good
  * We had explicit conversations about priorities
  * Time to work on content
  * Focused on one theme with workshops during the week.
  * Docs are coming along.
  * Sherif's flow for the workshops was good. Ownership of an epic is good. Pointing out where someone can get involved is helpful.

* Bad
  * First attempt at priority: the situation with back and forth priorirty is distracting.
  * Oracle priority changed, which took time away from other focus
  * Still working in isolation.
  * Most of my work was in the wrong direction. It would have been alleviated up front.

* Improve
  * We're not fully in the loop with RL1. We should
  * More early signal on shared tasks. "I want to predict waht someone is focused on at a high level".
    * Try: add more structure to standup.
  * Whenever we notice something coming up, pull in one other person.
  * Increase ownership of epics and delegation for subtasks.

### Notes
